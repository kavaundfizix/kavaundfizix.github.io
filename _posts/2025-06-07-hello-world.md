## Hello, World

I think this is a "felt cute, might delete later" kind of post. I do not have a clear outline of what I want to say, which is very atypical of me. Let this be my debut, my "first line of code" in a "new 'language'". 

I want this to be a place where I can write about *anything*, however, that freedom comes with great challenges. Being spontaneous like a typical exothermic reaction is not an easy task as it requires you to let energy out of the system. Nevertheless, I will (although most probably very clumsily) attempt to execute this project the way I see fit. 

I started this blog in part because I think in this day and age people do not write enough. Writing is probably the best outlet for reflection and consolidation of knowledge that I have ever witnessed. In Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel" (I love this book and it will be referenced in my writings probably more than one may anticipate) writing was described as a very important technology for lack of a better word. It has been invented from scratch only a couple times in different parts of the world. All other writing systems were borrowed, inspired by, or adapted from the original ones. It is extremely difficult to put the sounds of language into coherent symbols that do not only describe it but also do it in a way that is not too bulky (like having 276457210912 characters with complicated structures). Yet, I highly doubt that it would be easy to find a person who would say that all these years of effort were useless. 

Writing things down is one of my passions. I love note-taking strategies and everything to do with pen and paper (nothing against digital notes though). Taking good notes is really important not only because it helps you remember the things you write down better, but also because good notes make the information more accessible for you at a later time. In the future, I am considering dedicating a whole blog entry just about studying and note-taking, but yes notes are very important and can be very fun as soon as you find what works for you (:

Different types of journaling and note-taking can also be used for personal reflection, therapeutic explorations of one's mind, time management, artistic expression, and many more things. The most unexpected part of the process of writing for yourself or for whatever audience you choose to write for recreationally, is that you do not need a good start and you do not need a plan. As an aspiring scientist, I tend to approach everything in my life very scientifically, sometimes even *too scientifically*. However, I strongly believe that if you do get inspired to write (not talking about highschool essays, obviously), please accept that there is no science or, rather, there is as much science behind writing as you allow to be there. The most important thing to do is to start writing. The first few words and sentences are half the battle. After that, your mind will slowly start to flow out on whatever medium you are pouring it out on. There are no rules for that.

Being inspired is not a bad thing either, however. We always first learn by watching and then by doing but I think one's ultimate goal with writing should be to develop their personal voice. In this journey, it is particularly important to not lose yourself and be scared of being "cringe". Don't kill the part of you that's cringe, kill the part that cringes. Just start writing, I am almost 100% sure it will make an impact in your life.

So this is my "helloworld". I think it will suffice for now and I am hoping to write more soon as the summer break is approaching!
